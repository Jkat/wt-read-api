# How to contribute

By participating in this project there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow:

## Getting Started 
1. Login with your Github account or create one now

## Contributing with an Issue
2. If you find a mistake and you're not sure how to fix it, or you don't know how to do a pull request, then you can file an Issue. Filing an Issue will help us see the problem and fix it.
  * Create a [new Issue](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-nodejs-api/issues/new) clearly described!

## Contributing with a Pull Request
2. [Fork](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-nodejs-api/) the WindingTree repository. Work on your fork.
3. Create a new branch on which to make your change, e.g.
`git checkout -b my_code_contribution`, or make the change on the `proposal/next` branch.
4. Make commits of logical and atomic units.
5. Please do one pull request PER functionality, to avoid large merges.
6. Commit your change. Include a commit message describing the correction.
7. In case of being necessary make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes. Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken. 
8. Submit a pull request against the WindingTree repository.
